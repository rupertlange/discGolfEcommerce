Hi there!

Description: This is a website that I built using the Python based Django framework, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This is an e-commerce website that allows users and guests to shop for and purchase items. The data is handled by Django's framework
and stores information on the users, guest shoppers, orders, and products. I implemented PayPal purchasing integration which is handled by
PayPal's REST API. 

Thanks for reading!
